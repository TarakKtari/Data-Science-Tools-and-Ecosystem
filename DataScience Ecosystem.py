# ## Data Science Tools and Ecosystem
# ## Objectives:
# 
# * List popular languages for Data Science
# * Identify common data science libraries
# * Explore data science tools
# * Convert minutes to hours using Python
# 

# #### In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.
# 

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 
# 1. Python: Python is a general-purpose language that is well-suited for data science because of its readability, ease of use, and large ecosystem of libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
# 
# 2. R: R is a programming language specifically designed for statistical computing and graphics. It is widely used in data science for tasks such as statistical analysis, data modeling, and machine learning.
# 
# 3. SQL: SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language used to interact with databases. It is essential for data scientists to be able to query and manipulate data stored in databases.
# 
# 4. Julia: Julia is a relatively new programming language that is gaining popularity in the data science community. It is known for its speed, efficiency, and ability to handle large datasets.
# 
# 5. Java: Java is a versatile programming language that can be used for a wide variety of tasks, including data science. It is often used for developing large-scale data processing applications.
# 
# 6. Scala: Scala is a functional programming language that is gaining popularity in the data science community. It is known for its scalability, expressiveness, and ability to handle large datasets.
# 

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 
# 1. **NumPy:** NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It provides efficient numerical operations on arrays, matrices, and other multidimensional data structures. NumPy is widely used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
# 
# 2. **Pandas:** Pandas is a library for data analysis and manipulation in Python. It provides high-level data structures and functions for working with tabular data, such as DataFrames and Series. Pandas is widely used for data cleaning, wrangling, and exploratory data analysis.
# 
# 3. **Matplotlib:** Matplotlib is a comprehensive 2D plotting library for Python. It provides a variety of functions for creating charts, graphs, and other visualizations. Matplotlib is widely used for data visualization and exploration.
# 
# 4. **Scikit-learn:** Scikit-learn is a machine learning library for Python. It provides a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Scikit-learn is widely used for machine learning modeling and experimentation.
# 
# 5. **TensorFlow:** TensorFlow is an open-source end-to-end differentiable programming platform for machine learning. It is used for building and deploying a wide variety of models, including deep learning models. TensorFlow is widely used for deep learning and neural network applications.
# 
# 6. **PyTorch:** PyTorch is another open-source end-to-end differentiable programming platform for machine learning. It is similar to TensorFlow in its capabilities, but it offers a more Pythonic syntax and a more dynamic runtime. PyTorch is gaining popularity in the deep learning community.

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.

# In[1]:


##This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers.
(3*4)+5


# In[2]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
hours = 200 / 60
print(hours)
